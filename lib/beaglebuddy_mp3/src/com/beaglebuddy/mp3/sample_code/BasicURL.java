/**
 * This code demonstrates how to open an .mp3 file via a URL.
 * <p>
 * When you load an .mp3 file from a URL, the Beaglebuddy MP3 library treats the .mp3 file as being read only.  For that reason, you can not change any of the information
 * in the .mp3 file, nor can you save it.  You may only read the values that are currently stored in the .mp3 file.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Please note that the URL must be correctly encoded.  That is, it must conform to <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1738.txt">RFC 1738</a>.  A more user friendly explanation can be found at
 * the <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_urlencode.asp">HTML URL Encoding Reference</a>.  Also note that the java class <i>java.net.URLEncoder</a> does not work properly when passed
 * an entire URL.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Thus, the following URL will not work in java: http://www.beaglebuddy.com/content/downloads/mp3/01.Hells Bells.mp3<br/>
 * Instead, you must specify the correctly encoded URL to the MP3 constructor as: http://www.beaglebuddy.com/content/downloads/mp3/01.Hells%20Bells.mp3
 * </p>
 * Another issue when accessing an .mp3 file through a URL is the use of proxy servers.
 * If you run into the problem of being able to access an .mp3 file in your web browser, such as the following: <br/>
 * <a href="http://www.beaglebuddy.com/content/downloads/mp3/01.Hells%20Bells.mp3">http://www.beaglebuddy.com/content/downloads/mp3/01.Hells%20Bells.mp3</a><br/>
 * but using the exact same URL in your java program does not work (you get a connection time out error message), then perhaps you're internet connection is
 * utilizing a proxy server.  If so, you can solve this problem by specifying the proxy server's host and port as system properties in one of two ways:
 * <ol>
 *    <li>Specifying them as Defines on the command line to the java JRE</li>
 *    <li>Specifying them with java code in your application</li>
 * </ol>
 * <br/>
 * To specify them on the command line, do something like the following: <br/>
 * <code>
 * <pre>
 * %java_jre_home%\java -Dhttp.proxyHost=usproxy.mycompany.com -Dhttp.proxyPort=9000 -classpath beaglebuddy_mp3.jar;. com.beaglebuddy.mp3.sample_code.BasicURL
 * </pre>
 * </code>
 * To specify them in your code, add the following two lines to your code<br/>
 * <code>
 * <pre>
 * System.setProperty("http.proxyHost", "usproxy.mycompany.com");
 * System.setProperty("http.proxyPort", "9000");
 * </pre>
 * </code>
 * </p>
